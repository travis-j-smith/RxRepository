# RxRepository

This is my sample project demonstrating my RxRepository pattern for the Nashville CocoaHeads group.  My presentation slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16gxdLGHXuH7mlJLRNTJOcfz5a4xIwPB4KAzYnpc2e2M/edit?usp=sharing).

## Getting Started

To run this app, you’ll need to create an account with [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).  Make a file named Keys.plist in the RxRepository folder and put your API key there under the key WeatherAPIKey.  If you don’t the app will deliberately crash when attempting to make a network request.

## License

MIT sounds good.  Use my code if it helps you.
